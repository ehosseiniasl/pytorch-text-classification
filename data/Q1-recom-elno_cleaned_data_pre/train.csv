heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it.,-

don't you just love baked brie? i make mine either in puff pastry (but find it's too heavy these days )& also in a phyllo wrap. here's how i do it: remove all the wrapping from a whole brie and cut off about 1/8' off the top, leaving a smooth surface of brie without the rind. then cut off the edges. turn brie upside down and remove the rest of the rind. you now have a naked brie. cover with plastic wrap and set aside. melt a stick of butter and set aside. place 1 sheet of phyllo on a flat surface with the long end in front of you. butter the sheet. place another sheet of phyllo on top of the first sheet, overlapping half of the first sheet. you now have 1-1/2 widths of phyllo in front of you. butter that sheet, but positioned over the first sheet. place a fourth sheet over the third sheet, but positioned directly over the second sheet. you now have 4 sheets of phyllo. you have a double thickness of phyllo, 1-1/2 times the original width. now do the same thing with the height, placing the 5th sheet of phyllo.....i guess you get the idea. don't worry that the middle is thicker. it's going to support the weight of the brie. when you've used 8 sheets of phyllo, give it another brush with butter, place the brie in the center of the buttered phyllo pile. if you want to add something on top of the brie, now is the time to do it. i sometimes spread the top with pesto and sprinkle the pesto layer with pignoli nuts. another idea is to make a paste of sun dried tomatoes and cured black olives and spread that on top of the brie. you could also leave it plain, but the topping do add a wonderful flavor. now to wrap-it's done just like a package. 5flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. the brie inside will have melted. cut into wedges & serve. flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. the brie inside will have melted. cut into wedges & serve.,1 whl brie 1 stk butter melted Phyllo dough

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce.,-

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above). while your pizzocheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often savoy cabbage. slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (i like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. instead of savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldn't find savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving. bring a large pot of water to the boil, while the vegetables are cooking, melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g/2oz. per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage. allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors. do not allow the butter to brown; the garlic should brown, if at all, only slightly. remove the garlic and sage when you're done. while the butter is simmering, either slice or shred some mild, semi-soft cheese, the most classic choices being the local cheeses bitto or valtellina casera. but since these cheeses are hard to find, even in italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. and if you can't find fontina, i'd recommend staying in the alps and using either gruyère or emmenthal. grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano. i like to use a lot of cheese as well, say 50g/2 oz. per serving, although you can use much less if you prefer a lighter dish.,-

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce.,-

lukins. verbatim. just sorta caught my eye as i flipped though the book looking fer ideas. would like to mention that when i worked at a vegetarian restaurant, we did a daily 'square meal' that consisted of (usually) some sort of bean, a grain, veggie/salad, fresh bread. anywho....made a dish we called jamaican red beans and rice...to which i of course lost the recipe. but*this* recipe is about what i remember the spices being that we added to the cooked red beans, hence, this coconut condiment added to some nice red beans and served over rice should be excellent with the addition of some added chiles, o' course. [author's intro:] 'malaysian restaurateur aziza ali lives in singapore, where she owns the finest restaurant - aziza's. her spice combinations, especially this coconut condiment, fascinated me. in her 'serunding' [ital.] mixture, aziza combines the coconut with sweet and savory spices. delicate toasting brings out all the flavors. serve it sprinkled over malay oxtail soup, thai coconut ratatouille, or exotic lamb curry (see index). i also like to serve this as a garnish for curries.' preheat the oven to 350degrees f. in a large bowl lightly toss all the ingredients together with your hands, making sure that the garlic and spices are well distributed. spread the coconut mixture on a baking sheet and toast on the center rack of the oven, until pale golden, 5 to 7 minute, shaking the pan twice. check after 5 minutes to be sure the coconut doesn't burn. remove to let cool and dry out slightly. store in an airtight jar until use. this will keep 3 to 4 weeks.,4

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two).,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min. rinse the fish fillet (skin on or off) under cold water. place fish flat, skin side down, in the boiling stock. be sure liquid just barely covers the fillet. add more hot water if necessary. reduce the heat to med. avoid a rolling boil now or the fish will overcook and break apart. fish should just barely simmer, with no bubbles, for 10 - 15 min, depending on the thickness. remove skillet from heat and promptly lift fillet from hot liquid, using a large spatula (with holes) or two smaller spatulas. do not allow fish to sit in hot liquid and overcook. serve poached fish fillet hot, right out of the poaching bouillon. or chill them for a next-day lucheon buffet. quickly wrap freshly poached fillets in sheets of plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. allow to cool onthe counter for 10 min, then place inthe refrigerator and chill up to 24 hrs. remove from refrigerator 20 min before serving and garnish with lemon slices.,Would you like me to recommend side.dishes to serve with your fish?

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min. rinse the fish fillet (skin on or off) under cold water. place fish flat, skin side down, in the boiling stock. be sure liquid just barely covers the fillet. add more hot water if necessary. reduce the heat to med.,Would you like to see a video?

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat.,-

place water, butter, 2 table spoons oil, 1 tea spoon sugar & a pinch of salt into a medium – large size sauce pan. bring to the boil. add plain flour and mix vigorously until well blended (the dough will come together in a minute or two). remove from the stove and let it cool a bit. once it is not too hot, add one egg and work the egg into the dough. start slowly breaking the egg, then fast increasing speed, if possible. when the egg is incorporated in the dough, add another one and repeat the process. you should get dough that is not too stiff but not too soft either. tip: if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle). check if the oil is ready for frying by dropping a tiny piece of the dough in. once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in. pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (i found fork the best tool for this). do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. it will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden colour and that is a sign they are ready. they should get the colour gradually. if you see they are not getting dark evenly, reduce the temperature. take them out and place them on a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil. when they are still warm, roll each of them in a sugar mixed with ground cinnamon. serve warm with thick hot chocolate.,-

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce. add one part of hoisin sauce to a saucepan. i usually use 4 tablespoons. add one part of water. i usually add 4 tablespoons of water. add 1/2 part of sesame oil. i usually add 2 tablespoons. add 1/2 part of shaoxing huatiao wine. i usually add 2 tablespoons. if you have no idea what this wine is, use this picture to find it in asian stores. the 3 words in yellow says “hua tiao jiu”, which means hua tiao wine. place the saucepan over a low heat and whisk gently to combine. when the sauce starts to simmer, it's ready. do not boil.,-

lukins. verbatim. just sorta caught my eye as i flipped though the book looking fer ideas. would like to mention that when i worked at a vegetarian restaurant, we did a daily 'square meal' that consisted of (usually) some sort of bean, a grain, veggie/salad, fresh bread. anywho....made a dish we called jamaican red beans and rice...to which i of course lost the recipe. but*this* recipe is about what i remember the spices being that we added to the cooked red beans, hence, this coconut condiment added to some nice red beans and served over rice should be excellent with the addition of some added chiles, o' course. [author's intro:] 'malaysian restaurateur aziza ali lives in singapore, where she owns the finest restaurant - aziza's. her spice combinations, especially this coconut condiment, fascinated me. in her 'serunding' [ital.] mixture, aziza combines the coconut with sweet and savory spices. delicate toasting brings out all the flavors. serve it sprinkled over malay oxtail soup, thai coconut ratatouille, or exotic lamb curry (see index). i also like to serve this as a garnish for curries.' preheat the oven to 350degrees f. in a large bowl lightly toss all the ingredients together with your hands, making sure that the garlic and spices are well distributed. spread the coconut mixture on a baking sheet and toast on the center rack of the oven, until pale golden, 5 to 7 minute, shaking the pan twice.,4

preheat the oven to 200 degrees. first, approach the shrimp. i bought the frozen variety, but feel free to buy fresh if you'd like. thaw the shrimp, peel and de-vein. i like to remove the entire tail, but you may choose to keep it. after you've de-veined the shrimp, give them another rinse under the cold water. pat dry with a paper towel. add a bit of white pepper and a pinch of cayenne to the shrimp. on three plates, lay out season flour, the beaten egg. add the cornmeal to the third plate, or, if you prefer, a large plastic zip lock bag. drag through the flour, egg wash, and bathe in cornmeal using your preferred method. while the shrimp are basking in the cornmeal, focus on the grits. for this recipe, cook the grits as directed on the package, approximately 12-14 minutes. just like pasta, remember to salt the water. about a teaspoon will do. while the grits are cooking away, add the oil to a medium hot pan and fry shrimp on each side for 3-4 minutes. as they come out of the pan, remove them to a foil-lined cookie sheet and place in the oven to keep warm this should bring you close to your final cheddar cheese approach with the grits. around minute 11 or 12, grate about a cup of cheddar cheese and a crack or two of mrs. p (pepper, for the uninitiated). stir the grated cheese into the grits until it starts to blend completely into the grits. while stirring, notice that the grits continue to emit starch and take on water, becoming more porridge like by the moment. don't over stir the grits. grits don't do well when they're over agitated. they tend to stiffen, which isn't what we're looking for. we want a nice, creamy, cheesy, happy grit. as this comes together to a consistency of your liking, remove the shrimp from the oven. add grits to the plat or to a bowl, and top with as many shrimp as you'd like. i added about 5-7 per plate. serve with something green. i chose asparagus, which accompanied the dish nicely.,-

this recipe appeared in my cookbook, when we lived in russian far east near china. i love to cook this salad on a day to day basis or for a dinner party.

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over.,-

(buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above). while your pizzocheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often savoy cabbage. slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (i like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. instead of savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldn't find savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving. bring a large pot of water to the boil, while the vegetables are cooking, melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g/2oz. per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage. allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors. do not allow the butter to brown; the garlic should brown, if at all, only slightly. remove the garlic and sage when you're done. while the butter is simmering, either slice or shred some mild, semi-soft cheese, the most classic choices being the local cheeses bitto or valtellina casera. but since these cheeses are hard to find, even in italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. and if you can't find fontina, i'd recommend staying in the alps and using either gruyère or emmenthal. grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano. i like to use a lot of cheese as well, say 50g/2 oz. per serving, although you can use much less if you prefer a lighter dish. after the vegetables have been boiling for about 5 minutes, add your pizzocheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes. pizzocheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta—if you taste after about 5 minutes, you may see that although the pasta is already al dente, there is a raw quality to it, due to the particular qualities of buckwheat.,-
preheat oven to 200° c (400 °f) for 15 minutes. place red peppers and broil for about 30 minutes or until skins are blackened. transfer peppers to plastic wrap or bag. close the bag or seal with plastic wrap, and let peppers steam and cool. unwrap peppers. pull off and discard skins. this step can be done under running water. blend peppers, 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of parmigiano reggiano cheese. the pepper sauce will have a creamy consistency due to combining extra virgin olive oil with parmigiano reggiano, so there is no need to add heavy cream. try the sauce before adding salt since parmigiano reggiano cheese has already salt, and then add salt and pepper to taste. heat a skillet with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and saute zucchini until slightly crumbled and golden. add salt and pepper to taste.,-

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll.,-

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan.,-

make the pizza base first. mix together the water, yeast and maple syrup and leave for 5-10 minutes until it becomes bubbly. add the flour and salt and mix until the dough comes together. you may need to add a little more or less flour depending on the humidity of your kitchen. the dough shouldn't be too sticky and should come together in one dough. knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it is silky smooth, then place into a greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise for 60-90 minutes until doubled in size. while the dough is rising, make the ranch sauce by finely chopping the herbs, mincing the garlic clove and mixing everything together with the soy yoghurt and lemon juice. taste and season as you like. to make the parmesan, place all ingredients into a food processor and blitz until it resembles grated parmesan. you probably won't use all of this on top of the pizza. preheat the oven to 200°c. once the dough has doubled in size, roll it out into a large circle so the dough is roughly 1/4 inch thick. spread over a thin layer of ranch sauce (keep the rest for dipping!) and top with the sliced red onion, artichokes and spinach, and sprinkle with some of the parmesan. bake on a piece of parchment paper placed directly on the oven shelf for 15 minutes or until the base is golden and crisps.,-

this recipe appeared in my cookbook, when we lived in russian far east near china. i love to cook this salad on a day to day basis or for a dinner party. (just serve the salad in puff pastry baskets). the ingredients for this salad are simple and may be found in every pantry. wash and boil carrot, in separate pot wash and boil rice, in separate pot boil eggs (until hard boiled). rice has to be boiled but not too soft and over cooked. carrot has to be cooked, but not overcooked. when the rice is cooked, drain it and rinse with cold water. eggs: when cooked (in 6-8 min) put in cold water to cool off. carrot drain and let it cool down. peel and finely chop the onion (1/2 of it),3

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony.,-

(eggplant and garlic should be put in the oven at the same time so they come out of the oven at the same time.) while the vegetables are roasting, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. stir in shallots and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. stir in wine, water, salt, pepper, tomatoes, and thyme. bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. remove eggplant and garlic from oven. set garlic aside to cool. eggplant will let off steam when cut into, so be careful. cut off stem end of eggplant, then cut eggplant in half lengthwise and scoop out flesh into a bowl. flesh should separate easily from skin. when all the flesh has been removed, transfer to pot. discard the skin. with wet hands, remove cooled garlic from its skin and add to pot. garlic will still be hot, so be careful. if your hands are wet, the papery garlic skin will not stick to them as much, and it's also soothing when handling the hot garlic. simmer, covered, for 10 minutes so flavors combine. at this point the soup looks a little like a sea monster convention. not to worry: you will soon transform it into a thing of scrumptious beauty. let soup cool, uncovered, for 15 minutes. puree soup in batches in blender or use an immersion (hand) blender and puree in the pot. if using a regular blender, after you put the soup into the blender and the top is on securely, hold a dish towel over the top of the blender so you don't jackson pollack your kitchen with soup. add salt and pepper to taste. add more water in ½-cup increments, if needed. with each addition of liquid, also add salt and pepper to taste. place 2 or 3 slices of toasted baguette in bottom of each ovenproof soup crock or bowl. how many pieces you use will depend on the size of your crock. ladle soup carefully over the baguette slices, making sure the bread stays at the bottom of the crock.,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min.,Do you need me to make a shopping list?

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce. add one part of hoisin sauce to a saucepan. i usually use 4 tablespoons. add one part of water. i usually add 4 tablespoons of water. add 1/2 part of sesame oil. i usually add 2 tablespoons.,-

break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them. don't beat them and don't whisk them to a froth. just make them smooth in the bowl. because the eggs are the only rising material in the mixture, this maneuver is better underdone than overdone. then mix everything together well in a big container. as the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied. boil in a bag for one hour.,-

break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them. don't beat them and don't whisk them to a froth. just make them smooth in the bowl. because the eggs are the only rising material in the mixture, this maneuver is better underdone than overdone. then mix everything together well in a big container. as the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied.,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus.,-

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce. add one part of hoisin sauce to a saucepan. i usually use 4 tablespoons. add one part of water. i usually add 4 tablespoons of water. add 1/2 part of sesame oil. i usually add 2 tablespoons. add 1/2 part of shaoxing huatiao wine. i usually add 2 tablespoons. if you have no idea what this wine is, use this picture to find it in asian stores. the 3 words in yellow says “hua tiao jiu”, which means hua tiao wine. place the saucepan over a low heat and whisk gently to combine. when the sauce starts to simmer, it's ready. do not boil. set the sauce aside in a bowl and place in the fridge to chill. in the meantime, place one part of salted roasted peanuts in a food processor. i usually use 4 tablespoons of peanuts. whisk the processor till the peanuts are finely ground. when you are ready to serve the spring rolls, add the ground peanuts to the sauce and stir well to combine. the sauce is ready to use. serve the rolls with the peanut sauce.,-

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly.,-

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls.,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method.,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min. rinse the fish fillet (skin on or off) under cold water. place fish flat, skin side down, in the boiling stock. be sure liquid just barely covers the fillet. add more hot water if necessary. reduce the heat to med. avoid a rolling boil now or the fish will overcook and break apart. fish should just barely simmer, with no bubbles, for 10 - 15 min, depending on the thickness. remove skillet from heat and promptly lift fillet from hot liquid, using a large spatula (with holes) or two smaller spatulas. do not allow fish to sit in hot liquid and overcook.,-

in a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is 110-115 deg f. (when making the new york variation, omit the sugar and proceed as follows). sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently until it dissolves, about 1 minute. let stand in a warm spot until a thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. discard mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes. if making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use as the flour in the directions that follow. if making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow. to mix and knead the dough by hand: combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. while kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky. this should take about 5 minutes. as you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springy. too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the fl after mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg f) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to 1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast. with your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to prevent overrising. shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air bubbles. if you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1 hour. omit this step if using all-purpose flour.,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min. rinse the fish fillet (skin on or off) under cold water. place fish flat, skin side down, in the boiling stock. be sure liquid just barely covers the fillet. add more hot water if necessary. reduce the heat to med. avoid a rolling boil now or the fish will overcook and break apart. fish should just barely simmer, with no bubbles, for 10 - 15 min, depending on the thickness.,Do you want to see a video of simmering vs boiling?

place water, butter, 2 table spoons oil, 1 tea spoon sugar & a pinch of salt into a medium – large size sauce pan. bring to the boil. add plain flour and mix vigorously until well blended (the dough will come together in a minute or two). remove from the stove and let it cool a bit. once it is not too hot, add one egg and work the egg into the dough. start slowly breaking the egg, then fast increasing speed, if possible. when the egg is incorporated in the dough, add another one and repeat the process. you should get dough that is not too stiff but not too soft either. tip: if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle).,Show what the piping tip looks like

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles.,-

( i have a machine that will cut the log into shells-but you don't really need one.) with a very sharp knife, cut the log into 3/4' pieces-or smaller-then with the tines of a fork, press the piece and roll it toward you so that it makes the indentation of the fork on one side and a slight indentation across on the other side and it looks sort of like a shell. sprinkle lightly with flour and let dry for an hour. to cook: place in a pot of boiling salted water. they take about 10 minutes to cook. to serve: you can serve the gnocci with your favorite spaghetti sauce. we sometimes serve it with the following sauce: heat the olive oil and butter in a heavy frying pan. when the butter begins to sizzle add the garlic and saute just until the garlic begins to turn golden. remove from the heat and add the water. pour over the gnocci and sprinkle on the cheese. mix well. you can add a little garlic salt if you like.,5

don't you just love baked brie? i make mine either in puff pastry (but find it's too heavy these days )& also in a phyllo wrap. here's how i do it: remove all the wrapping from a whole brie and cut off about 1/8' off the top, leaving a smooth surface of brie without the rind. then cut off the edges. turn brie upside down and remove the rest of the rind. you now have a naked brie. cover with plastic wrap and set aside. melt a stick of butter and set aside. place 1 sheet of phyllo on a flat surface with the long end in front of you. butter the sheet. place another sheet of phyllo on top of the first sheet, overlapping half of the first sheet. you now have 1-1/2 widths of phyllo in front of you. butter that sheet, but positioned over the first sheet. place a fourth sheet over the third sheet, but positioned directly over the second sheet. you now have 4 sheets of phyllo. you have a double thickness of phyllo, 1-1/2 times the original width. now do the same thing with the height, placing the 5th sheet of phyllo.....i guess you get the idea. don't worry that the middle is thicker. it's going to support the weight of the brie. when you've used 8 sheets of phyllo, give it another brush with butter, place the brie in the center of the buttered phyllo pile. if you want to add something on top of the brie, now is the time to do it. i sometimes spread the top with pesto and sprinkle the pesto layer with pignoli nuts. another idea is to make a paste of sun dried tomatoes and cured black olives and spread that on top of the brie. you could also leave it plain, but the topping do add a wonderful flavor. now to wrap-it's done just like a package. 5flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. the brie inside will have melted. cut into wedges & serve.,1 whl brie 1 stk butter melted Phyllo dough

crack eggs into a medium-size bowl and add milk, lemon thyme, and salt and pepper. whisk in the milk and break up the yolks. set aside. in a very large, ovenproof saute pan (about 12 to 14 inches), heat butter until melted. add shallots and garlic, and saute over high heat until you can smell the aroma. add onion and saute until tender. add vegetables and saute until al dente or tender. add crabmeat and mix well. pour eggs into the vegetables and crabmeat and stir with a fork to mix. continue cooking over high heat, constantly stirring with the fork until the eggs just start to set. move to oven, and continue cooking on the first rack under the broiler, just until the eggs set, about 3 to 4 minutes. remove from oven and slice into quarters. sprinkle grated parmesan cheese on top and garnish with fresh lemon wedges.,-
place water, butter, 2 table spoons oil, 1 tea spoon sugar & a pinch of salt into a medium – large size sauce pan. bring to the boil. add plain flour and mix vigorously until well blended (the dough will come together in a minute or two). remove from the stove and let it cool a bit. once it is not too hot, add one egg and work the egg into the dough. start slowly breaking the egg, then fast increasing speed, if possible. when the egg is incorporated in the dough, add another one and repeat the process. you should get dough that is not too stiff but not too soft either. tip: if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle). check if the oil is ready for frying by dropping a tiny piece of the dough in. once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in. pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (i found fork the best tool for this). do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. it will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden colour and that is a sign they are ready. they should get the colour gradually. if you see they are not getting dark evenly, reduce the temperature. take them out and place them on a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil. when they are still warm, roll each of them in a sugar mixed with ground cinnamon.,-

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat.,-

break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them. don't beat them and don't whisk them to a froth. just make them smooth in the bowl. because the eggs are the only rising material in the mixture, this maneuver is better underdone than overdone. then mix everything together well in a big container. as the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag.,This is what the bag should look like

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock,-

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce.,-

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above). while your pizzocheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often savoy cabbage. slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (i like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. instead of savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldn't find savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving. bring a large pot of water to the boil,,-

we'll start out by making the dough for our ravioli. add to a food processor all of your ravioli ingredients. run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. if the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. it should form a nice ball of dough. once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes. cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes. while your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. now add in the garlic. next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms. let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach. let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat. now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli. rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic.,a link to this step

break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them. don't beat them and don't whisk them to a froth. just make them smooth in the bowl. because the eggs are the only rising material in the mixture, this maneuver is better underdone than overdone. then mix everything together well in a big container. as the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied. boil in a bag for one hour. it is all right to add water during the cooking, but don't let the boiling stop at any time.,-

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above).,Method showing

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top.,-

we'll start out by making the dough for our ravioli. add to a food processor all of your ravioli ingredients. run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. if the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. it should form a nice ball of dough. once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes. cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes. while your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. now add in the garlic. next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms. let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach. let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat. now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli. rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic. now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble. drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated.,a link to this step

we'll start out by making the dough for our ravioli. add to a food processor all of your ravioli ingredients. run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. if the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. it should form a nice ball of dough. once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes. cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes. while your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. now add in the garlic. next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms. let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach. let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat. now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli. rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic. now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble. drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated. serve them up with a little grated parmesan or romano over the top.,a link to this step

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest.,-

boil the florettes for 3-4 minutes in plenty of water, to which a tablespoon of milk has been added. drain and pat dry on a clean cloth. make thin batter out of flour and 2 tablespooncornflour, adding 1/4 teaspoon each of ginger and garlic and red chilli powder and salt to taste. dip the florettes in the batter one by one and deep fry in hot oil. keep aside. in the remaining oil, add remaining ginger, garlic and crushed red chilli and fry for a minute. add the salt and spring onions. stir fry for a minute. add 1 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil. add 1 tablespoon cornflour to 1/4 cup water and dissolve well. gradually add to the gravy and stir continuously till it resumes boiling. boil till the gravy becomes transparent. add florettes and soya sauce.,-
heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this.,-

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet.,-
