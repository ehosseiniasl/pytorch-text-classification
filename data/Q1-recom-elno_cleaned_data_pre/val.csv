sponge / method: separate the yolks and whites. with clean beaters, whip the whites with 1/2 cup sugar until firm. keep aside add the remaining sugar to the yolks and beat until tripled in volume or all the sugar has dissolved and the yolks are pale and creamy, about 8-10 minutes now add 1/3 of the beaten egg whites and fold in gently so as not to release any beaten in air. sift in half the flour and fold in gently, followed by 1/3 beaten whites, then remaining flour, and finally remaining beaten whites. gently turn into prepared tin, and bake at 180c for 25-30 minutes until a tester comes out clean. remove from tin immediately, peel off parchment and cool completely on rack. bavarian cream / method: whisk the egg yolks with a balloon whisk with 1/3 cup of vanilla sugar until smooth. simmer 1/2 cup of milk and 200ml cream with 1 scraped vanilla bean, bean included. turn off heat and allow to infuse for 30 minutes. bloom gelatin in 3 tbsps of cold milk put the pan back on simmer. once the milk mixture comes to a boil, take it off the heat and whisk into the yolk mix, somewhat like in french pastry cream. return to a heavy bottom pan, and place on medium heat until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon, stirring constantly. take off and whisk in bloomed gelatin. strain and leave to cool. (you can quicken the cooling by stirring the bowl held over a bowl of ice.) once it is completely cooled, whip 200ml of cream with 1-2 tbsps of castor sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and fold it into the custard gently but thoroughly. you will notice the bavarian thickening. while the custard is cooling, slice the sponge into two, and gently paint with some sugar syrup with a little lime juice added. this moistens the sponge a bit. place the lower layer on your serving platter within a cake/dessert ring. arrange chopped strawberries and cover with the cooled bavarian cream, which will be held within the mold. place the top layer over it, and gently push over cream to level it. cling wrap the entire thing, and chill for 8 hours, preferably overnight for the bavarian to set.,5

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side.,-

pour milk into large bowl. add pudding mix. beat with whisk until well blended, 1-2 minutes. let stand 5 minutes. stir in whipped topping and half of crushed cookies.,-
break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them. don't beat them and don't whisk them to a froth. just make them smooth in the bowl. because the eggs are the only rising material in the mixture, this maneuver is better underdone than overdone. then mix everything together well in a big container. as the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied. boil in a bag for one hour. it is all right to add water during the cooking, but don't let the boiling stop at any time. serve the pudding with warm custard.,-

oven at 500 degrees i posted about this garlic oil last week for our caprese pasta and heres another opportunity for us to use it! add 1 cup olive oil and 15 smashed garlic cloves into a small saucepan. on the smallest burner and on the lowest heat allow to simmer for 25-30 minutes. the oil will look slightly cloudy in the end.  allow to cool slightly before handling. for this recipe you'll need 3 tbsp of the garlic oil (be sure to get some of the actual garlic too). in a sauté pan add the oil and cook the baby spinach until just wilted. season with salt and pepper. remove from the heat and add to a bowl. in the same bowl add the ricotta, grated cheese and chopped artichoke hearts. season with salt and pepper. mix until well combined. i have no problem admitting that i use shortcuts here and there, and pizza dough is always one of them! while i used the pillsbury here you can certainly buy a piece of dough from your favorite pizza shop. go ahead and roll out the pizza dough onto a well floured pizza peel or straight onto a floured baking sheet. add a layer of the mixture and top with  the shredded mozzarella.,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min. rinse the fish fillet (skin on or off) under cold water. place fish flat, skin side down, in the boiling stock. be sure liquid just barely covers the fillet. add more hot water if necessary. reduce the heat to med. avoid a rolling boil now or the fish will overcook and break apart. fish should just barely simmer, with no bubbles, for 10 - 15 min, depending on the thickness. remove skillet from heat and promptly lift fillet from hot liquid, using a,-

one of the tricks to the incredible flavor in this risotto is the broth so lets start there. in a saucepan over medium heat add 3 tbsp butter and all the mushrooms. season with salt and pepper. once a good amount of the moisture is cooked out of the mushrooms and they are lightly browned add in the vegetable broth, water and chopped parsley. simmer for 20 minutes and voila, beautiful mushroom broth. once the broth has been cooking for 15 minutes you can go ahead and start the risotto. in a large sauté pan (the rice will plump up quite a bit!) over medium low heat add 3 tbsp butter and the oil. add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. season with salt and pepper. next add in the arborio rice and toss to coat well with the mixture. continue to stir until the rice is toasted and opaque (clear with just a speck of white in the center of the grain). at this point the fabulous broth will be ready, keep it over low heat. using a slotted spoon add the mushrooms from the broth into the risotto and mix to combine. add in the wine and continue stirring until the wine is all absorbed. next, add a couple ladles of broth to the rice and continue stirring until absorbed. you will continue doing this process until the rice is completely cooked through and the risotto is creamy. taste and adjust seasoning if necessary with salt and pepper. you don't want to overcook this otherwise you'll end up with a very sticky clumpy risotto. in the end you want to see each grain on its own. you can certainly add a little more broth if you want a looser consistency then i have pictured at the top. finish it off with a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. and grated cheese if you'd like. i have mine served over sautéed broccoli rabe.,improved visualization

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-
