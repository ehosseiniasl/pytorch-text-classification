preparation:,4
make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil.,-

in a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is 110-115 deg f. (when making the new york variation, omit the sugar and proceed as follows). sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently until it dissolves, about 1 minute. let stand in a warm spot until a thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. discard mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes. if making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use as the flour in the directions that follow. if making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow. to mix and knead the dough by hand: combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. while kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky. this should take about 5 minutes. as you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springy. too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the fl after mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg f) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to 1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast. with your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to prevent overrising. shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air bubbles. if you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1 hour. omit this step if using all-purpose flour. if you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. the dough can be punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. let chilled dough come to room temperature before proceeding. instructions on dough-making with a food processor and professional mixing bowl.,-

one of the tricks to the incredible flavor in this risotto is the broth so lets start there. in a saucepan over medium heat add 3 tbsp butter and all the mushrooms. season with salt and pepper. once a good amount of the moisture is cooked out of the mushrooms and they are lightly browned add in the vegetable broth, water and chopped parsley. simmer for 20 minutes and voila, beautiful mushroom broth. once the broth has been cooking for 15 minutes you can go ahead and start the risotto. in a large sauté pan (the rice will plump up quite a bit!) over medium low heat add 3 tbsp butter and the oil. add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. season with salt and pepper. next add in the arborio rice and toss to coat well with the mixture. continue to stir until the rice is toasted and opaque (clear with just a speck of white in the center of the grain). at this point the fabulous broth will be ready, keep it over low heat. using a slotted spoon add the mushrooms from the broth into the risotto and mix to combine. add in the wine and continue stirring until the wine is all absorbed. next, add a couple ladles of broth to the rice and continue stirring until absorbed. you will continue doing this process until the rice is completely cooked through and the risotto is creamy. taste and adjust seasoning if necessary with salt and pepper. you don't want to overcook this otherwise you'll end up with a very sticky clumpy risotto. in the end you want to see each grain on its own. you can certainly add a little more broth if you want a looser consistency then i have pictured at the top. finish it off with a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley.,improved visualization

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above). while your pizzocheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often savoy cabbage. slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (i like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. instead of savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldn't find savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving. bring a large pot of water to the boil, while the vegetables are cooking, melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g/2oz. per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage. allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors. do not allow the butter to brown; the garlic should brown, if at all, only slightly. remove the garlic and sage when you're done. while the butter is simmering, either slice or shred some mild, semi-soft cheese, the most classic choices being the local cheeses bitto or valtellina casera. but since these cheeses are hard to find, even in italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. and if you can't find fontina, i'd recommend staying in the alps and using either gruyère or emmenthal. grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano. i like to use a lot of cheese as well, say 50g/2 oz. per serving, although you can use much less if you prefer a lighter dish. after the vegetables have been boiling for about 5 minutes, add your pizzocheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes. pizzocheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta—if you taste after about 5 minutes, you may see that although the pasta is already al dente, there is a raw quality to it, due to the particular qualities of buckwheat. while the pizzocheri are cooking, warm a serving bowl in the oven. when you are ready to serve, take your serving bowl out of the oven and, fishing them out of the water with a large slotted spoon, add a layer of well drained pizzocheri and vegetables, then top with some of the cheeses, seasoning if you like with salt and pepper:,-

in a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is 110-115 deg f. (when making the new york variation, omit the sugar and proceed as follows). sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently until it dissolves, about 1 minute. let stand in a warm spot until a thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. discard mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes. if making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use as the flour in the directions that follow. if making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow. to mix and knead the dough by hand: combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. while kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky. this should take about 5 minutes. as you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springy. too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the fl after mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg f) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to 1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast.,-

directions preheat oven to 375 °f (190 degrees). use a round 9-10 inch (24cm) silicone backing dish. if you use a tart pan or a glass pan dish it needs to be slightly greased. for the crust take ground flax seed and mix it with 3 tbs water in a small bowl to gel up for 5 minutes. use a large bowl and mix the almond flour, oat flour, salt, herbs, water and coconut oil together with the flaxseed. the dough must be sticky between your fingers before you work it evenly into the baking dish.,-
in a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is 110-115 deg f. (when making the new york variation, omit the sugar and proceed as follows). sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently until it dissolves, about 1 minute. let stand in a warm spot until a thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. discard mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes. if making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use as the flour in the directions that follow. if making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow. to mix and knead the dough by hand: combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. while kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky. this should take about 5 minutes. as you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springy. too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the fl after mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg f) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to 1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast. with your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to prevent overrising. shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air bubbles. if you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1 hour. omit this step if using all-purpose flour. if you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. the dough can be punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. let chilled dough come to room temperature before proceeding.,-

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended.,-

( i have a machine that will cut the log into shells-but you don't really need one.) with a very sharp knife, cut the log into 3/4' pieces-or smaller-then with the tines of a fork, press the piece and roll it toward you so that it makes the indentation of the fork on one side and a slight indentation across on the other side and it looks sort of like a shell. sprinkle lightly with flour and let dry for an hour.,5

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min. rinse the fish fillet (skin on or off) under cold water. place fish flat,,-

place water, butter, 2 table spoons oil, 1 tea spoon sugar & a pinch of salt into a medium – large size sauce pan. bring to the boil. add plain flour and mix vigorously until well blended (the dough will come together in a minute or two). remove from the stove and let it cool a bit. once it is not too hot, add one egg and work the egg into the dough. start slowly breaking the egg, then fast increasing speed, if possible. when the egg is incorporated in the dough, add another one and repeat the process. you should get dough that is not too stiff but not too soft either. tip: if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle). check if the oil is ready for frying by dropping a tiny piece of the dough in. once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in. pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (i found fork the best tool for this). do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. it will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden colour and that is a sign they are ready. they should get the colour gradually. if you see they are not getting dark evenly, reduce the temperature. take them out and place them on a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil.,-

we'll start out by making the dough for our ravioli. add to a food processor all of your ravioli ingredients. run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. if the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. it should form a nice ball of dough. once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes. cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes. while your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. now add in the garlic. next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms. let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach. let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat. now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli. rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked),a link to this step

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers.,-

prepare the crust: put the flour, confectioners' sugar and salt into a food processor and pulse a few times just to combine. sprinkle the pieces of butter and pulse until the butter is coarse. the sizes don't have to be uniform. begin adding the egg yolk a little bit at a time. pulsing after each addition. when the entire egg has been added, process in long 10 second pulses until the dough forms clumps and curds. just before this happens, the sound of the machine will change, so be careful not to over pulse. i only have a mini food-prep and i managed to make this by preparing it in 4 separate batches. preheat the oven to 375f. butter a fluted 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. press the dough evenly onto the bottom of the pan and up the sides. save a small piece to patch up any cracks that may occur during baking. be careful not to press too hard. be gentle.,-

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken.,-

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above). while your pizzocheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often savoy cabbage. slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (i like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. instead of savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldn't find savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving. bring a large pot of water to the boil, while the vegetables are cooking, melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g/2oz. per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage. allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors. do not allow the butter to brown; the garlic should brown, if at all, only slightly. remove the garlic and sage when you're done.,-
