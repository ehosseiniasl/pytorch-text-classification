 cut up the ingredients into pieces that will fit through the feeder and toss together thoroughly. place a bowl under the outlet end and get the sausage casing ready. use the stomper to push the sausage ingredients down and into the grinder and guide the ground mixture into the casing. when done, tie the casing off into 5'/13cm lengths. if you prefer, you can also grind directly into a bowl and make patties to fry. to store, you can hang the links up to dry if you live in a dry enough climate, or you can refrigerate them up to 10 days or freeze them. the traditional way to store them when not dried, however, is to pack them in lard, where they keep a very long time without refrigeration. packing the chorizos in lard also greatly increases their storage life in the refrigerator. the ratio for storage is 1/2 gallon lard per pound of sausages or 2kg lard per 500g sausages. if you choose this st if you have dried the chorizo, you can eat as is once thoroughly dried. if not, you can fry it or cook it in traditional soup and stew dishes.,Show a video of this step and show the correct consistency.
