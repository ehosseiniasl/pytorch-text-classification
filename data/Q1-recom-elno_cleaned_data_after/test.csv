 start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce. add one part of hoisin sauce to a saucepan. i usually use 4 tablespoons. add one part of water. i usually add 4 tablespoons of water. add 1/2 part of sesame oil. i usually add 2 tablespoons. add 1/2 part of shaoxing huatiao wine. i usually add 2 tablespoons. if you have no idea what this wine is, use this picture to find it in asian stores. the 3 words in yellow says “hua tiao jiu”, which means hua tiao wine. place the saucepan over a low heat and whisk gently to combine. when the sauce starts to simmer, it's ready. do not boil. set the sauce aside in a bowl and place in the fridge to chill. in the meantime, place one part of salted roasted peanuts in a food processor. i usually use 4 tablespoons of peanuts. whisk the processor till the peanuts are finely ground. when you are ready to serve the spring rolls, add the ground peanuts to the sauce and stir well to combine. the sauce is ready to use. serve the rolls with the peanut sauce.,-

 rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic. now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble. drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated. serve them up with a little grated parmesan or romano over the top.,a link to this step

 leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

if you can boil water, you can poach a fish fillet. it's that easy. one mistake you should guard against is overcooking the fillet. even though poaching is a moist way to cook fish, it is important to halt the process as soon as the fish is fully cooked. most fish cooked longer then 30 min usually turns out dry, with a strong, unpleasant odor. an aromatic poaching liquid greatly enhances the flavor, helps keep cooking odors pleasant and totally eliminates the need for adding calorie-laden oil or butter. a flavorful poaching stock can easily be brewed by boiling water for a short time with a variety of herbs and spices and sliced lemon, lime or orange. whole fish like trout or flounder can be succesfully poached in a roasting pan on top of the stove. but smaller, more delicate portions of fish fillet is more practical for family meals. tail-end fillets of salmon are boneles, poach quickly and are readily available. but you'll find most varieties of fish - flounder, sole, trout, halibut, cod, red snapper, rock fish - are also superb when prepared using the poaching method. here is a a fail-safe technique for poaching fish fillets using herbs, spices and citrus. to make a flavorful poaching stock, pour water into a large straight-sided skillet or elecric frying pan. add mixed pickling spices, bay leaves and lemon slices. bring to a boil over high heat and cook for 5 min. rinse the fish fillet (skin on or off) under cold water. place fish flat, skin side down, in the boiling stock. be sure liquid just barely covers the fillet. add more hot water if necessary. reduce the heat to med. avoid a rolling boil now or the fish will overcook and break apart. fish should just barely simmer, with no bubbles, for 10 - 15 min, depending on the thickness. remove skillet from heat and promptly lift fillet from hot liquid, using a large spatula (with holes) or two smaller spatulas. do not allow fish to sit in hot liquid and overcook. serve poached fish fillet hot, right out of the poaching bouillon. or chill them for a next-day lucheon buffet. quickly wrap freshly poached fillets in sheets of plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. allow to cool onthe counter for 10 min, then place inthe refrigerator and chill up to 24 hrs. remove from refrigerator 20 min before serving and garnish with lemon slices.,Would you like me to set a timer for your cooking time?

 if making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow. to mix and knead the dough by hand: combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. while kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky. this should take about 5 minutes. as you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springy. too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the fl after mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg f) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to 1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast. with your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to prevent overrising. shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air bubbles. if you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1 hour. omit this step if using all-purpose flour. if you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. the dough can be punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. let chilled dough come to room temperature before proceeding. instructions on dough-making with a food processor and professional mixing bowl.,-
