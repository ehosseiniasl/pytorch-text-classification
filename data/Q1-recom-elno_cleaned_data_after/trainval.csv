 remove from the stove and let it cool a bit. once it is not too hot, add one egg and work the egg into the dough. start slowly breaking the egg, then fast increasing speed, if possible. when the egg is incorporated in the dough, add another one and repeat the process. you should get dough that is not too stiff but not too soft either. tip: if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle). check if the oil is ready for frying by dropping a tiny piece of the dough in. once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in. pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (i found fork the best tool for this). do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. it will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden colour and that is a sign they are ready. they should get the colour gradually. if you see they are not getting dark evenly, reduce the temperature. take them out and place them on a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil. when they are still warm, roll each of them in a sugar mixed with ground cinnamon. serve warm with thick hot chocolate.,Again, show the recommended dough texture desired by the end of this step

 while the butter is simmering, either slice or shred some mild, semi-soft cheese, the most classic choices being the local cheeses bitto or valtellina casera. but since these cheeses are hard to find, even in italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. and if you can't find fontina, i'd recommend staying in the alps and using either gruyère or emmenthal. grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano. i like to use a lot of cheese as well, say 50g/2 oz. per serving, although you can use much less if you prefer a lighter dish. after the vegetables have been boiling for about 5 minutes, add your pizzocheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes. pizzocheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta—if you taste after about 5 minutes, you may see that although the pasta is already al dente, there is a raw quality to it, due to the particular qualities of buckwheat. while the pizzocheri are cooking, warm a serving bowl in the oven. when you are ready to serve, take your serving bowl out of the oven and, fishing them out of the water with a large slotted spoon, add a layer of well drained pizzocheri and vegetables, then top with some of the cheeses, seasoning if you like with salt and pepper:,-

 this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied. boil in a bag for one hour. it is all right to add water during the cooking, but don't let the boiling stop at any time. serve the pudding with warm custard.,-

 i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

 i am sorry that i do not remember who it was that sugested sauteeing in the microwave, but i want to thank you, whoever you were, and report that it works beautifully. i used that technique on this recipe. the original recipe called for cooking this along with some beef soup bones or short ribs. i had intended to make some defatted beef broth and use that instead of the water to cook it in, saving the beef to cut up in my sad eating husbands portion. i may try this another time, although it was quite delicious as it was. i also think that when cooking it in the crockpot, it would be ok to put all of the ingredients in at once in the beginning instead of waiting to add the peas, lentils and barley later.,Laptop

 while your pizzocheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often savoy cabbage. slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (i like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. instead of savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldn't find savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving. bring a large pot of water to the boil, while the vegetables are cooking, melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g/2oz. per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage. allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors. do not allow the butter to brown; the garlic should brown, if at all, only slightly. remove the garlic and sage when you're done. while the butter is simmering, either slice or shred some mild, semi-soft cheese, the most classic choices being the local cheeses bitto or valtellina casera. but since these cheeses are hard to find, even in italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. and if you can't find fontina, i'd recommend staying in the alps and using either gruyère or emmenthal. grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano. i like to use a lot of cheese as well, say 50g/2 oz. per serving, although you can use much less if you prefer a lighter dish. after the vegetables have been boiling for about 5 minutes, add your pizzocheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes. pizzocheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta—if you taste after about 5 minutes, you may see that although the pasta is already al dente, there is a raw quality to it, due to the particular qualities of buckwheat. while the pizzocheri are cooking, warm a serving bowl in the oven. when you are ready to serve, take your serving bowl out of the oven and, fishing them out of the water with a large slotted spoon, add a layer of well drained pizzocheri and vegetables, then top with some of the cheeses, seasoning if you like with salt and pepper:,-

chop your onion. cut your green pepper and sausage into thin slices. saute in a frying pan with a small amount of heated oil. season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. while you're sauteing the first three ingredients peel and devein your shrimp. once the vegetables soften and the sausage shows the first signs of browning add the shrimp. cook together until the shrimp just begin to pink. this can happen quickly depending on the size of your shrimp. add enough chicken broth to allow the mixture to float. not too much. i prefer a light broth so i only use chicken broth. if you prefer more of a creamy or gravy sauce add cream to the mixture. let simmer and thicken for a few minutes, enough time to allow the shrimp to cook throughout depending on the type of grits you are using allow enough time to prepare so that the grits will finish the same time as your shrimp mixture. i often will just use instant grits that only take 5 minutes to prepare. add cubes of cheese to taste to give your grits that extra boost of flavor. a few suggestions are cheddar cheese, pepper jack, or gouda. serve the shrimp mixture over a bed of grits.,-
 keep a watch on the pan and do not allow the onions to burn.  if it appears the are beginning to burn add a little water to slow the cooking process.  if you find it necessary to add water, as you add it deglaze the pan scraping up any brown bits (fond). continue to allow the onions to cook turning occasionally. after 30 -40 minutes you should have fairly good results.  at this time add the sugar and stir to combine, then let the onions brown more in the pan turning once in a while to keep them from burning. once the onions are completely browned leave the pan on low and begin your steaks. just before the steaks are finished, bring the onions up to a medium high heat add the balsamic vinegar deglazing the pan with it.  stir to combine, remove from the heat and  top on the steaks and enjoy.,-

 to mix and knead the dough by hand: combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. while kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky. this should take about 5 minutes. as you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springy. too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the fl after mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg f) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to 1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast. with your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to prevent overrising. shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air bubbles. if you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1 hour. omit this step if using all-purpose flour. if you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. the dough can be punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. let chilled dough come to room temperature before proceeding. instructions on dough-making with a food processor and professional mixing bowl.,-

'she made a variety of pickles from tiny cucumbers in brine with garlic and dill (*but never vinegar*), and these were stored in a large earthenware crock until they were semi-ripe and ready to be eaten. she marinated green peppers in oil, vinegar and garlic and stored them for a week in large candy jars in our great wire-mesh food-safe. sometimes she would let me accompany her to the market, and there she would pick the greenest tomatoes for her pickling bottles.',6 Green peppers 1 cup White wine vinegar 2 tablespoons Water 1/2 cup Olive oil 1 Bay leaf 1 teaspoon Salt 1 teaspoon Sugar 3 Peppercorns, bruised 2 Cloves garlic, peeled
 for this recipe, cook the grits as directed on the package, approximately 12-14 minutes. just like pasta, remember to salt the water. about a teaspoon will do. while the grits are cooking away, add the oil to a medium hot pan and fry shrimp on each side for 3-4 minutes. as they come out of the pan, remove them to a foil-lined cookie sheet and place in the oven to keep warm this should bring you close to your final cheddar cheese approach with the grits. around minute 11 or 12, grate about a cup of cheddar cheese and a crack or two of mrs. p (pepper, for the uninitiated). stir the grated cheese into the grits until it starts to blend completely into the grits. while stirring, notice that the grits continue to emit starch and take on water, becoming more porridge like by the moment. don't over stir the grits. grits don't do well when they're over agitated. they tend to stiffen, which isn't what we're looking for. we want a nice, creamy, cheesy, happy grit. as this comes together to a consistency of your liking, remove the shrimp from the oven. add grits to the plat or to a bowl, and top with as many shrimp as you'd like. i added about 5-7 per plate. serve with something green. i chose asparagus, which accompanied the dish nicely.,-

 slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce. add one part of hoisin sauce to a saucepan. i usually use 4 tablespoons. add one part of water. i usually add 4 tablespoons of water. add 1/2 part of sesame oil. i usually add 2 tablespoons. add 1/2 part of shaoxing huatiao wine. i usually add 2 tablespoons. if you have no idea what this wine is, use this picture to find it in asian stores. the 3 words in yellow says “hua tiao jiu”, which means hua tiao wine. place the saucepan over a low heat and whisk gently to combine. when the sauce starts to simmer, it's ready. do not boil. set the sauce aside in a bowl and place in the fridge to chill. in the meantime, place one part of salted roasted peanuts in a food processor. i usually use 4 tablespoons of peanuts. whisk the processor till the peanuts are finely ground. when you are ready to serve the spring rolls, add the ground peanuts to the sauce and stir well to combine. the sauce is ready to use. serve the rolls with the peanut sauce.,-

we'll start out by making the dough for our ravioli. add to a food processor all of your ravioli ingredients. run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. if the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. it should form a nice ball of dough. once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes. cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes. while your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. now add in the garlic. next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms. let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach. let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat. now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli. rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic. now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble. drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated. serve them up with a little grated parmesan or romano over the top.,a link to this step

in a small bowl, dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is 110-115 deg f. (when making the new york variation, omit the sugar and proceed as follows). sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently until it dissolves, about 1 minute. let stand in a warm spot until a thin layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes. discard mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes. if making whole-wheat dough, combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use as the flour in the directions that follow. if making the cornmeal dough, combine the flour and cornmeal in a bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow. to mix and knead the dough by hand: combine 3 cups of the flour with the salt in a large mixing bowl. make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. using a wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in the center, and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. dust your hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself. shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. while kneading, very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer sticky or tacky. this should take about 5 minutes. as you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the work surface. continue kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springy. too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the fl after mixing and kneading the dough, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a well-oiled bowl, turning to coat completely on all sides with oil. cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place (75-85 deg f) until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to 1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast. with your fist, punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in bulk to prevent overrising. shape it into a ball, pressing out all the air bubbles. if you are using bread flour or semolina flour, turn the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover again with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy, from 35 minutes to 1 hour. omit this step if using all-purpose flour. if you cannot bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising, punch the dough down again, turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. the dough can be punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable. let chilled dough come to room temperature before proceeding. instructions on dough-making with a food processor and professional mixing bowl.,-

 add plain flour and mix vigorously until well blended (the dough will come together in a minute or two). remove from the stove and let it cool a bit. once it is not too hot, add one egg and work the egg into the dough. start slowly breaking the egg, then fast increasing speed, if possible. when the egg is incorporated in the dough, add another one and repeat the process. you should get dough that is not too stiff but not too soft either. tip: if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle). check if the oil is ready for frying by dropping a tiny piece of the dough in. once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in. pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (i found fork the best tool for this). do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. it will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden colour and that is a sign they are ready. they should get the colour gradually. if you see they are not getting dark evenly, reduce the temperature. take them out and place them on a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil. when they are still warm, roll each of them in a sugar mixed with ground cinnamon. serve warm with thick hot chocolate.,Show the desired texture of the dought

 reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

 cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

 if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle). check if the oil is ready for frying by dropping a tiny piece of the dough in. once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in. pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (i found fork the best tool for this). do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. it will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden colour and that is a sign they are ready. they should get the colour gradually. if you see they are not getting dark evenly, reduce the temperature. take them out and place them on a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil. when they are still warm, roll each of them in a sugar mixed with ground cinnamon. serve warm with thick hot chocolate.,Show what the dough texture you DON'T want, e.g. how it looks when the eggs scramble

 turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

 when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

 add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce. add one part of hoisin sauce to a saucepan. i usually use 4 tablespoons. add one part of water. i usually add 4 tablespoons of water. add 1/2 part of sesame oil. i usually add 2 tablespoons. add 1/2 part of shaoxing huatiao wine. i usually add 2 tablespoons. if you have no idea what this wine is, use this picture to find it in asian stores. the 3 words in yellow says “hua tiao jiu”, which means hua tiao wine. place the saucepan over a low heat and whisk gently to combine. when the sauce starts to simmer, it's ready. do not boil. set the sauce aside in a bowl and place in the fridge to chill. in the meantime, place one part of salted roasted peanuts in a food processor. i usually use 4 tablespoons of peanuts. whisk the processor till the peanuts are finely ground. when you are ready to serve the spring rolls, add the ground peanuts to the sauce and stir well to combine. the sauce is ready to use. serve the rolls with the peanut sauce.,-

don't you just love baked brie? i make mine either in puff pastry (but find it's too heavy these days )& also in a phyllo wrap. here's how i do it: remove all the wrapping from a whole brie and cut off about 1/8' off the top, leaving a smooth surface of brie without the rind. then cut off the edges. turn brie upside down and remove the rest of the rind. you now have a naked brie. cover with plastic wrap and set aside. melt a stick of butter and set aside. place 1 sheet of phyllo on a flat surface with the long end in front of you. butter the sheet. place another sheet of phyllo on top of the first sheet, overlapping half of the first sheet. you now have 1-1/2 widths of phyllo in front of you. butter that sheet, but positioned over the first sheet. place a fourth sheet over the third sheet, but positioned directly over the second sheet. you now have 4 sheets of phyllo. you have a double thickness of phyllo, 1-1/2 times the original width. now do the same thing with the height, placing the 5th sheet of phyllo.....i guess you get the idea. don't worry that the middle is thicker. it's going to support the weight of the brie. when you've used 8 sheets of phyllo, give it another brush with butter, place the brie in the center of the buttered phyllo pile. if you want to add something on top of the brie, now is the time to do it. i sometimes spread the top with pesto and sprinkle the pesto layer with pignoli nuts. another idea is to make a paste of sun dried tomatoes and cured black olives and spread that on top of the brie. you could also leave it plain, but the topping do add a wonderful flavor. now to wrap-it's done just like a package. 5flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. the brie inside will have melted. cut into wedges & serve. flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. the brie inside will have melted. cut into wedges & serve.,1 whl brie 1 stk butter melted Phyllo dough
 add the white chocolate candy melts into a microwave-safe bowl. microwave for 30 seconds and stir. repeat microwaving for 30 seconds and stirring until the candy melts are completely melted. add half of the white chocolate into the bottom of the tin foil lined pan. spread evenly with an offset spatula. let harden. to speed up the process, place in the fridge for about 15 minutes or until it has set up. once the white chocolate is hard, dump the animal cracker mixture on it. spread it out as evenly as possible using your hands or wax paper. i used my hands because it was easier and what i had available. reheat the white chocolate if needed by microwaving for 30 seconds and stirring. pour the remaining white chocolate on top of the animal cracker mixture. try to drizzle it all over so it's easier to coat everything. working quickly, add the pink candy melts into a sandwich bag. microwave for 30 seconds and stir. pinch the back and flip it over in the microwave. repeat microwaving and pinching the bag until smooth. cut a small corner out of the sandwich bag. drizzle the pink candy melt over top of the wet white chocolate. give it a nice little design and fill in any holes. tap the pan on the counter to smooth out the chocolate. sprinkle the nonpareils on top of the chocolate. don't tap it again otherwise your sprinkles will sink down in. place into the fridge to chill. this will take about 1 hour. cut the bark with a sharp knife. if it starts cracking, cut along the crack. go with the flow. store in the fridge.,An image of the end result.
 if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic. now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble. drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated. serve them up with a little grated parmesan or romano over the top.,a link to this step

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above). while your pizzocheri are drying, prepare the vegetables that will accompany them, typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable, most often savoy cabbage. slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (i like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. instead of savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldn't find savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving. bring a large pot of water to the boil, while the vegetables are cooking, melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g/2oz. per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage. allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors. do not allow the butter to brown; the garlic should brown, if at all, only slightly. remove the garlic and sage when you're done. while the butter is simmering, either slice or shred some mild, semi-soft cheese, the most classic choices being the local cheeses bitto or valtellina casera. but since these cheeses are hard to find, even in italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. and if you can't find fontina, i'd recommend staying in the alps and using either gruyère or emmenthal. grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano. i like to use a lot of cheese as well, say 50g/2 oz. per serving, although you can use much less if you prefer a lighter dish. after the vegetables have been boiling for about 5 minutes, add your pizzocheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes. pizzocheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta—if you taste after about 5 minutes, you may see that although the pasta is already al dente, there is a raw quality to it, due to the particular qualities of buckwheat. while the pizzocheri are cooking, warm a serving bowl in the oven. when you are ready to serve, take your serving bowl out of the oven and, fishing them out of the water with a large slotted spoon, add a layer of well drained pizzocheri and vegetables, then top with some of the cheeses, seasoning if you like with salt and pepper:,Method showing

 verbatim. just sorta caught my eye as i flipped though the book looking fer ideas. would like to mention that when i worked at a vegetarian restaurant, we did a daily 'square meal' that consisted of (usually) some sort of bean, a grain, veggie/salad, fresh bread. anywho....made a dish we called jamaican red beans and rice...to which i of course lost the recipe. but*this* recipe is about what i remember the spices being that we added to the cooked red beans, hence, this coconut condiment added to some nice red beans and served over rice should be excellent with the addition of some added chiles, o' course. [author's intro:] 'malaysian restaurateur aziza ali lives in singapore, where she owns the finest restaurant - aziza's. her spice combinations, especially this coconut condiment, fascinated me. in her 'serunding' [ital.] mixture, aziza combines the coconut with sweet and savory spices. delicate toasting brings out all the flavors. serve it sprinkled over malay oxtail soup, thai coconut ratatouille, or exotic lamb curry (see index). i also like to serve this as a garnish for curries.' preheat the oven to 350degrees f. in a large bowl lightly toss all the ingredients together with your hands, making sure that the garlic and spices are well distributed. spread the coconut mixture on a baking sheet and toast on the center rack of the oven, until pale golden, 5 to 7 minute, shaking the pan twice. check after 5 minutes to be sure the coconut doesn't burn. remove to let cool and dry out slightly. store in an airtight jar until use. this will keep 3 to 4 weeks. makes 1 cup.,4

one of the tricks to the incredible flavor in this risotto is the broth so lets start there. in a saucepan over medium heat add 3 tbsp butter and all the mushrooms. season with salt and pepper. once a good amount of the moisture is cooked out of the mushrooms and they are lightly browned add in the vegetable broth, water and chopped parsley. simmer for 20 minutes and voila, beautiful mushroom broth. once the broth has been cooking for 15 minutes you can go ahead and start the risotto. in a large sauté pan (the rice will plump up quite a bit!) over medium low heat add 3 tbsp butter and the oil. add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. season with salt and pepper. next add in the arborio rice and toss to coat well with the mixture. continue to stir until the rice is toasted and opaque (clear with just a speck of white in the center of the grain). at this point the fabulous broth will be ready, keep it over low heat. using a slotted spoon add the mushrooms from the broth into the risotto and mix to combine. add in the wine and continue stirring until the wine is all absorbed. next, add a couple ladles of broth to the rice and continue stirring until absorbed. you will continue doing this process until the rice is completely cooked through and the risotto is creamy. taste and adjust seasoning if necessary with salt and pepper. you don't want to overcook this otherwise you'll end up with a very sticky clumpy risotto. in the end you want to see each grain on its own. you can certainly add a little more broth if you want a looser consistency then i have pictured at the top. finish it off with a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. and grated cheese if you'd like. i have mine served over sautéed broccoli rabe.,improved visualization

make sure you buy a good brand of rice paper. i once bought some that were impossible to handle and turned hard after a few minutes. they were awful to bite into afterwards. the rice sheets supposed to be very thin and are very fragile. start off by preparing the vegetables. i like to add a little carrot strips for colour. get one of those special peelers that cut finely julienned strips of carrots. they are incredible. slice spring onions into fine thin strips. cut some large slices of iceberg lettuce. get some fresh basil and mint. use only the leaves in whole pieces. boil a large pot of water. cook some rice noodles according to the package's instructions. i've used both fat rice noodles and skinny ones with success. so it really doesn't matter what kind you use. next, get some bacon. i'm lazy to slice fresh pork, so i use a good smoked shoulder bacon that are ready to use flat pieces of pork and has a wonderful flavour. pick the kind that are in large sheets with as little fat as possible. cook the bacon in the boiling water. don't cook for too long. once they turn pink, remove them from the water. i dump in the shrimp too. yes, all in the same pot. it really doesn't matter. cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. slice the shrimps horizontally into half. now we are ready to roll. prepare a large bowl of warm water. not boiling water. make sure you can dip your hands into it. slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. count to 3 and lift it out. do not soak the paper in the water. it should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. lay the rice sheet on a large plate. don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. it will soften by the time you roll it. lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. add slices of bacon on top. add the lettuce. then the basil. add the mint, carrots and spring onions. top with a small bit of noodles. do not over fill the roll. when there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. it's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. this is how you roll. lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. pull one side of the sheet over. and then the other side. finish by rolling over the rest of the rice sheet. lay the spring rolls on a tray or plate and cover with a clean damp cloth or cling-wrap film. keep them chilled in the fridge until ready to eat. now, make the peanut dipping sauce. add one part of hoisin sauce to a saucepan. i usually use 4 tablespoons. add one part of water. i usually add 4 tablespoons of water. add 1/2 part of sesame oil. i usually add 2 tablespoons. add 1/2 part of shaoxing huatiao wine. i usually add 2 tablespoons. if you have no idea what this wine is, use this picture to find it in asian stores. the 3 words in yellow says “hua tiao jiu”, which means hua tiao wine. place the saucepan over a low heat and whisk gently to combine. when the sauce starts to simmer, it's ready. do not boil. set the sauce aside in a bowl and place in the fridge to chill. in the meantime, place one part of salted roasted peanuts in a food processor. i usually use 4 tablespoons of peanuts. whisk the processor till the peanuts are finely ground. when you are ready to serve the spring rolls, add the ground peanuts to the sauce and stir well to combine. the sauce is ready to use. serve the rolls with the peanut sauce.,-

ms. sacerdoti's remarks: this dish is thought to be a speciality of roman jews. roman jewish cooking characteristically combined fish or meat with vegetables in a single dish. italian jewish cooking is as regional as italian cooking. if you cannot find anchovies and do not like sardines, try it with fillets of sole. i have noted a number of recipes where sole is used for a more refined version, and sardines prepared by those who could not afford the more expensive fish. 1. clean and gut the fish; remove backbone; rinse and drain. 2. discard hard outer leaves of the endive and remove the core. wash endire, drain, but don't dry it. 3. in a lightly oiled baking dish, arrange alternating layers of endives and fish (using at least a couple of leaves in each layer), beginning and ending with a triple layer of leaves. 4. sprinkle each layer with oil, salt , and pepper. 5. cover the baking dish, pressing the food down. 6.cook 15 minutes. 7. uncover and bake in 400 f (or 200 c) oven for half an hour, or until juices have evaporated and there is a golden crust on top. 8. serve hot or cold, with a sprinkling of lemon juice.,-

 once the broth has been cooking for 15 minutes you can go ahead and start the risotto. in a large sauté pan (the rice will plump up quite a bit!) over medium low heat add 3 tbsp butter and the oil. add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. season with salt and pepper. next add in the arborio rice and toss to coat well with the mixture. continue to stir until the rice is toasted and opaque (clear with just a speck of white in the center of the grain). at this point the fabulous broth will be ready, keep it over low heat. using a slotted spoon add the mushrooms from the broth into the risotto and mix to combine. add in the wine and continue stirring until the wine is all absorbed. next, add a couple ladles of broth to the rice and continue stirring until absorbed. you will continue doing this process until the rice is completely cooked through and the risotto is creamy. taste and adjust seasoning if necessary with salt and pepper. you don't want to overcook this otherwise you'll end up with a very sticky clumpy risotto. in the end you want to see each grain on its own. you can certainly add a little more broth if you want a looser consistency then i have pictured at the top. finish it off with a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. and grated cheese if you'd like. i have mine served over sautéed broccoli rabe.,improved visualization

 knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it is silky smooth, then place into a greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise for 60-90 minutes until doubled in size. while the dough is rising, make the ranch sauce by finely chopping the herbs, mincing the garlic clove and mixing everything together with the soy yoghurt and lemon juice. taste and season as you like. to make the parmesan, place all ingredients into a food processor and blitz until it resembles grated parmesan. you probably won't use all of this on top of the pizza. preheat the oven to 200°c. once the dough has doubled in size, roll it out into a large circle so the dough is roughly 1/4 inch thick. spread over a thin layer of ranch sauce (keep the rest for dipping!) and top with the sliced red onion, artichokes and spinach, and sprinkle with some of the parmesan. bake on a piece of parchment paper placed directly on the oven shelf for 15 minutes or until the base is golden and crisps. use the leftover ranch sauce.,-
put together the meat grinder attachment and sausage stuffer piece and insert it into the head of the mixer. tighten well. cut up the ingredients into pieces that will fit through the feeder and toss together thoroughly. place a bowl under the outlet end and get the sausage casing ready. use the stomper to push the sausage ingredients down and into the grinder and guide the ground mixture into the casing. when done, tie the casing off into 5'/13cm lengths. if you prefer, you can also grind directly into a bowl and make patties to fry. to store, you can hang the links up to dry if you live in a dry enough climate, or you can refrigerate them up to 10 days or freeze them. the traditional way to store them when not dried, however, is to pack them in lard, where they keep a very long time without refrigeration. packing the chorizos in lard also greatly increases their storage life in the refrigerator. the ratio for storage is 1/2 gallon lard per pound of sausages or 2kg lard per 500g sausages. if you choose this st if you have dried the chorizo, you can eat as is once thoroughly dried. if not, you can fry it or cook it in traditional soup and stew dishes.,Show a video of this step.

 while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

break the eggs into a bowl and whisk them. don't beat them and don't whisk them to a froth. just make them smooth in the bowl. because the eggs are the only rising material in the mixture, this maneuver is better underdone than overdone. then mix everything together well in a big container. as the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied. boil in a bag for one hour. it is all right to add water during the cooking, but don't let the boiling stop at any time. serve the pudding with warm custard.,How to beat eggs

 run the processor and mix the ingredients up well. if the dough looks like pebbles, it's a touch too dry. add about 1/2-1 tsp of water and mix again. it should form a nice ball of dough. once your dough is mixed, bring it out of the processor and knead it for a few minutes. cover your ball of pasta dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for a good twenty minutes. while your dough is resting, let's whip up the tasty filling. grab your skillet and heat up the butter on medium heat. now add in the garlic. next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms. let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach. let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat. now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli. rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic. now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble. drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated. serve them up with a little grated parmesan or romano over the top.,a link to this step

place water, butter, 2 table spoons oil, 1 tea spoon sugar & a pinch of salt into a medium – large size sauce pan. bring to the boil. add plain flour and mix vigorously until well blended (the dough will come together in a minute or two). remove from the stove and let it cool a bit. once it is not too hot, add one egg and work the egg into the dough. start slowly breaking the egg, then fast increasing speed, if possible. when the egg is incorporated in the dough, add another one and repeat the process. you should get dough that is not too stiff but not too soft either. tip: if the dough is too hot, you might end up with scrambled eggs in a dough or dough that tastes like scrambled eggs so be careful. if you work the egg fast into the dough it also prevents the egg from cooking. however, this may be a bit tricky, as the dough is quite hard at this point. if you find it hard to mix with a wooden spoon, use your hands instead. pour the vegetable/sunflower oil into a medium sized sauce pan and heat it up. fill a piping bag (or a ziplock bag) fitted with star piping tip with half of the dough (it is easier to handle). check if the oil is ready for frying by dropping a tiny piece of the dough in. once the dough turns nice brown, you are ready to pipe the churros in. pipe the dough directly into the hot oil (choose any length you like) and cut with a fork (i found fork the best tool for this). do not pipe too many churros in as they need space for frying. it will take only about 2 minutes for them to get nice golden colour and that is a sign they are ready. they should get the colour gradually. if you see they are not getting dark evenly, reduce the temperature. take them out and place them on a paper kitchen towel to get rid of the excess oil. when they are still warm, roll each of them in a sugar mixed with ground cinnamon. serve warm with thick hot chocolate.,-

 then mix everything together well in a big container. as the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. this done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. this will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. shake off excess flour. now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. the mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. in short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. if you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. if you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied. boil in a bag for one hour. it is all right to add water during the cooking, but don't let the boiling stop at any time. serve the pudding with warm custard.,-

 i've referred to this book before, 'memoirs and menus - the confessions of a culinary snob,' by georges spunt (1967, chilton book co.). today, i was sidetracked by some of the memoirs, which speak of a bygone era from the early part of this century through ww2 in shanghai. they are a total delight to read and a classic example of the jewish experience (sparkling, assimilated, urbane sophisticates ultimately reminded that they are jewish). his predisposition to meeting famous people followed him to san francisco, and he tells wonderful anecdotes, including how his cooking philosophy endorsing shortcut techniques evolved, starting with preparing a souffle' made with*canned* white sauce for duncan hines. it's worth making the effort to find and read this book, not to mention enjoying the excellent recipes. his chapter on jewish cooking is entitled, 'if you put in good' [... you take out good],' with recipes from his grandmother. 'she made a variety of pickles from tiny cucumbers in brine with garlic and dill (*but never vinegar*), and these were stored in a large earthenware crock until they were semi-ripe and ready to be eaten. she marinated green peppers in oil, vinegar and garlic and stored them for a week in large candy jars in our great wire-mesh food-safe. sometimes she would let me accompany her to the market, and there she would pick the greenest tomatoes for her pickling bottles.',6 Green peppers 1 cup White wine vinegar 2 tablespoons Water 1/2 cup Olive oil 1 Bay leaf 1 teaspoon Salt 1 teaspoon Sugar 3 Peppercorns, bruised 2 Cloves garlic, peeled

heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. when hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)when the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. reduce the heat to low and cover. leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. turn off heat and put onions aside. while your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. the idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)drain when cold and set aside. i browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge huge flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. this sauce is essentially a flavored roux. a roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. preheat your oven to 400 degrees. wash the lemon well. cut the lemon in half. use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. you'll need two medium sauce pans. put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. remove the peel and set peel aside. in the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)when melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. keep whisking once everything is incorporated. the sauce will thicken pretty quickly. turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!). turn off heat and stir in the 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and grind 1 teaspoon black pepper into the sauce. slowly whisk in 2 tablespoons reserved lemon juice till the mixture is well blended. take the lemon peel you set aside earlier, rinse it off (it will have cream on it) and zest it. if you don't have a citrus zester, you can usually find that your box grater has a side that works perfectly for this. you'll need less than 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest. stir zest in to the sauce. adjust salt and pepper seasoning. it should taste lightly like alfredo but very peppery and a little lemony. put the pizza shell on a cookie sheet or pizza stone and spread out the peppercorn lemon sauce thinly on it. top with broccoli, red onion, and chicken. add shredded cheddar, mozzarella and the last of the parmesan. bake for 10 minutes and then broil for 3 or 4 minutes till cheese begins to brown. cut into 4 -6 pieces. serve with slices of lemon.,-

 cut up the ingredients into pieces that will fit through the feeder and toss together thoroughly. place a bowl under the outlet end and get the sausage casing ready. use the stomper to push the sausage ingredients down and into the grinder and guide the ground mixture into the casing. when done, tie the casing off into 5'/13cm lengths. if you prefer, you can also grind directly into a bowl and make patties to fry. to store, you can hang the links up to dry if you live in a dry enough climate, or you can refrigerate them up to 10 days or freeze them. the traditional way to store them when not dried, however, is to pack them in lard, where they keep a very long time without refrigeration. packing the chorizos in lard also greatly increases their storage life in the refrigerator. the ratio for storage is 1/2 gallon lard per pound of sausages or 2kg lard per 500g sausages. if you choose this st if you have dried the chorizo, you can eat as is once thoroughly dried. if not, you can fry it or cook it in traditional soup and stew dishes.,Show a video of this step and show the correct consistency.

 first, approach the shrimp. i bought the frozen variety, but feel free to buy fresh if you'd like. thaw the shrimp, peel and de-vein. i like to remove the entire tail, but you may choose to keep it. after you've de-veined the shrimp, give them another rinse under the cold water. pat dry with a paper towel. add a bit of white pepper and a pinch of cayenne to the shrimp. on three plates, lay out season flour, the beaten egg. add the cornmeal to the third plate, or, if you prefer, a large plastic zip lock bag. drag through the flour, egg wash, and bathe in cornmeal using your preferred method. while the shrimp are basking in the cornmeal, focus on the grits. for this recipe, cook the grits as directed on the package, approximately 12-14 minutes. just like pasta, remember to salt the water. about a teaspoon will do. while the grits are cooking away, add the oil to a medium hot pan and fry shrimp on each side for 3-4 minutes. as they come out of the pan, remove them to a foil-lined cookie sheet and place in the oven to keep warm this should bring you close to your final cheddar cheese approach with the grits. around minute 11 or 12, grate about a cup of cheddar cheese and a crack or two of mrs. p (pepper, for the uninitiated). stir the grated cheese into the grits until it starts to blend completely into the grits. while stirring, notice that the grits continue to emit starch and take on water, becoming more porridge like by the moment. don't over stir the grits. grits don't do well when they're over agitated. they tend to stiffen, which isn't what we're looking for. we want a nice, creamy, cheesy, happy grit. as this comes together to a consistency of your liking, remove the shrimp from the oven. add grits to the plat or to a bowl, and top with as many shrimp as you'd like. i added about 5-7 per plate. serve with something green. i chose asparagus, which accompanied the dish nicely.,-

 next we'll add in the proscuitto, onions and mushrooms. let it cook up for a minute or two and then add in the salt and oregano. give it a swirl or two around the pan to mix in and then add in your spinach. let the spinach wilt down completely and then remove the mixture from the heat. now it's time to grab your well rested pasta dough and pop out some ravioli. rip off about a sixth of the ball and run it through your pasta maker (or hand roll it) to the desired thinness. if you have a ravioli cutter you can use that, or you can use a glass to cut circles, or you can do like we did and use a cookie cutter to make fun shapes celebrating the holiday. after you have your ravioli cut out, you'll drop a good teaspoonful of the prosciutto mixture into the center of the pasta. brush the edges with an egg wash (the egg white from one egg) and place another pasta piece over the top. seal the edges with your fingers, a fork, or whatever puts a smile on your face. grab a pot, fill it up with water and set it to boil. the pasta will cook up quick (it will float when cooked) grab another pan, drop the butter into it and cook it on medium until it turns a beautiful golden brown and gives off a lovely nutty smell. at this point you'll turn the heat down just a notch and add in your garlic. now drop in your chopped basil, give it a swirl or two to let the basil wilt and your butter sauce is ready to rumble. drain your cooked up ravioli, dump them in the butter sauce and get them good and coated. serve them up with a little grated parmesan or romano over the top.,a link to this step
