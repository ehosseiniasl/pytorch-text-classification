you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) i use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (i use setting '3' on my kitchenaid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above).,Method showing
