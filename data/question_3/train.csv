you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta but using a parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough some recipes call for less regular flour but the of ratio works well for me i use egg and a bit of water to bind the dough but the original recipe see below calls for water only you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta i use setting a on my kitchenmaid pasta roller and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel once dry enough cut the sheets into strips a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle say about a cm of inch wide and about a cm a in long allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish see photo above,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
while your pizzocheri are drying prepare the vegetables that will accompany them typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable most often savoy cabbage slice or cube the potato as you prefer i like them sliced and immerse them in cold water shred your cabbage and add it too to the water instead of savoy cabbage you can also use spinach swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldnt find savoy cabbage at the market—coste or the stalks of swiss chard trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g oz of leafy vegetable per serving bring a large pot of water to the boil,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
while the vegetables are cooking melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g2oz per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors do not allow the butter to brown the garlic should brown if at all only slightly remove the garlic and sage when youre done,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
after the vegetables have been boiling for about a minutes add your pizzocheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another of minutes pizzocheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta—if you taste after about a minutes you may see that although the pasta is already al dense there is a raw quality to it due to the particular qualities of buckwheat,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta but using a parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough some recipes call for less regular flour but the of ratio works well for me i use egg and a bit of water to bind the dough but the original recipe see below calls for water only you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta i use setting a on my kitchenmaid pasta roller and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel once dry enough cut the sheets into strips a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle say about a cm of inch wide and about a cm a in long allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish see photo above,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

you make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta but using a parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough some recipes call for less regular flour but the of ratio works well for me i use egg and a bit of water to bind the dough but the original recipe see below calls for water only you roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta i use setting a on my kitchenmaid pasta roller and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel once dry enough cut the sheets into strips a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle say about a cm of inch wide and about a cm a in long allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish see photo above,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
while your pizzocheri are drying prepare the vegetables that will accompany them typically potato and a leafy winter vegetable most often savoy cabbage slice or cube the potato as you prefer i like them sliced and immerse them in cold water shred your cabbage and add it too to the water instead of savoy cabbage you can also use spinach swiss chard leaves or—as i did this time when i couldnt find savoy cabbage at the market—coste or the stalks of swiss chard trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish but i like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g oz of leafy vegetable per serving bring a large pot of water to the boil,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
while the vegetables are cooking melt a nice big piece of butter—at least 50g2oz per serving to which you add a clove or two of garlic and a sprig of fresh sage allow the garlic and sage to simmer very gently in the melted butter until the butter is infused with their flavors do not allow the butter to brown the garlic should brown if at all only slightly remove the garlic and sage when youre done,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
after the vegetables have been boiling for about a minutes add your pizzocheri and lower the heat a bit and continue cooking for another of minutes pizzocheri take surprisingly long to cook for a fresh pasta—if you taste after about a minutes you may see that although the pasta is already al dense there is a raw quality to it due to the particular qualities of buckwheat,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
