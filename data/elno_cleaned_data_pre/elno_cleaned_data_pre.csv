Cook together until the shrimp just begin to pink. This can happen quickly depending on the size of your shrimp. Add enough chicken broth to allow the mixture to float. Not too much. I prefer a light broth so I only use chicken broth. If you prefer more of a creamy or gravy sauce add cream to the mixture. Let simmer and thicken for a few minutes, enough time to allow the shrimp to cook throughout Depending on the type of grits you are using allow enough time to prepare so that the grits will finish the same time as your shrimp mixture. I often will just use instant grits that only take 5 minutes to prepare. Add cubes of cheese to taste to give your grits that extra boost of flavor. A few suggestions are cheddar cheese, pepper jack, or gouda.",no

While sauce simmers, prepare Bechamel Sauce (recipe below) and eggplant; cut ends from eggplant (1 large or 2 small) and cut in 1/2-inch-thick slices (if using large, flask-type eggplant, peel the skin off in strips with a vegetable peeler - creating a striped look - with some of the peel left on and some off.  If using Japanese-style (the longish, purply-white ones), don't bother to peel at all); Place on a cookie sheet and brush with remaining olive oil; Place under broiler and broil until light brown; Remove from oven, salt lightly, turn eggplant and repeat pr There are three ways you can prepare the potatoes for this delicious casserole:  1) shallow-fry potato rounds in olive oil until golden-brown or, 2) for fewer calories, arrange the potato slices in your baking pan, brush lightly with olive oil, bake for 15 minutes, continue with assembly, or 3) if you want to cut calories further, parboil them for 8 minutes; drain well on paper towels.

Pierce eggplant all over with a fork. Place eggplant on baking sheet covered with aluminum foil. Roast for 30 minutes or until a fork easily pierces flesh. Meanwhile, slice off about ½ inch from the top of the head of garlic. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over top of garlic, wrap tightly in foil, and place in oven on separate baking sheet for 20 minutes. Unwrap and roast uncovered another 10 minutes. (Eggplant and garlic should be put in the oven at the same time so they come out of the oven at the same time.) While the vegetables are roasting, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in shallots and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in wine, water, salt, pepper, tomatoes, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove eggplant and garlic from oven. Set garlic aside to cool. Eggplant will let off steam when cut into, so be careful. Cut off stem end of eggplant, then cut eggplant in half lengthwise and scoop out flesh into a bowl. Flesh should separate easily from skin. When all the flesh has been removed, transfer to pot. Discard the skin. With wet hands, remove cooled garlic from its skin and add to pot. Garlic will still be hot, so be careful. If your hands are wet, the papery garlic skin will not stick to them as much, and it's also soothing when handling the hot garlic. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes so flavors combine. At this point the soup looks a little like a sea monster convention. Not to worry: You will soon transform it into a thing of scrumptious beauty. Let soup cool, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Puree soup in batches in blender or use an immersion (hand) blender and puree in the pot. If using a regular blender, after you put the soup into the blender and the top is on securely, hold a dish towel over the top of the blender so you don't Jackson Pollack your kitchen with soup. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add more water in ½-cup increments, if needed. With each addition of liquid, also add salt and pepper to taste. Place 2 or 3 slices of toasted baguette in bottom of each ovenproof soup crock or bowl. How many pieces you use will depend on the size of your crock. Ladle soup carefully over the baguette slices, making sure the bread stays at the bottom of the crock. Top each soup-filled crock with ½ cup shredded mozzarella.

Keep aside Add the remaining sugar to the yolks and beat until tripled in volume or all the sugar has dissolved and the yolks are pale and creamy, about 8-10 minutes Now add 1/3 of the beaten egg whites and fold in gently so as not to release any beaten in air. Sift in half the flour and fold in gently, followed by 1/3 beaten whites, then remaining flour, and finally remaining beaten whites. Gently turn into prepared tin, and bake at 180C for 25-30 minutes until a tester comes out clean. Remove from tin immediately, peel off parchment and cool completely on rack. Bavarian Cream / Method: Whisk the egg yolks with a balloon whisk with 1/3 cup of vanilla sugar until smooth. Simmer 1/2 cup of milk and 200ml cream with 1 scraped vanilla bean, bean included. Turn off heat and allow to infuse for 30 minutes. Bloom gelatin in 3 tbsps of cold milk Put the pan back on simmer. Once the milk mixture comes to a boil, take it off the heat and whisk into the yolk mix, somewhat like in French pastry cream. Return to a heavy bottom pan, and place on medium heat until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon, stirring constantly. Take off and whisk in bloomed gelatin. Strain and leave to cool. (You can quicken the cooling by stirring the bowl held over a bowl of ice.) Once it is completely cooled, whip 200ml of cream with 1-2 tbsps of Castor sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and fold it into the custard gently but thoroughly. You will notice the Bavarian thickening. While the custard is cooling, slice the sponge into two, and gently paint with some sugar syrup with a little lime juice added. This moistens the sponge a bit. Place the lower layer on your serving platter within a cake/dessert ring. Arrange chopped strawberries and cover with the cooled Bavarian cream, which will be held within the mold. Place the top layer over it, and gently push over cream to level it. Cling wrap the entire thing, and chill for 8 hours, preferably overnight for the Bavarian to set. Unmold gently the next day. Ganache /Method Whisk with a spoon till smooth and shiny. Leave to cool.

I dump in the shrimp too. Yes, all in the same pot. It really doesn't matter. Cut off visble bits of fat from the pork and slice them into half to get long strips. Slice the shrimps horizontally into half. Now we are ready to roll. Prepare a large bowl of warm water. Not boiling water. Make sure you can dip your hands into it. Slice a sheet of rice paper into the water. Count to 3 and lift it out. Do NOT soak the paper in the water. It should be stiff when you lift it out of the water. Lay the rice sheet on a large plate. Don't worry that it still feels stiff at this point. It will soften by the time you roll it. Lay the shrimp first to create a curved flat surface that will look nicer when the roll is complete. Add slices of bacon on top. Add the lettuce. Then the basil. Add the mint, carrots and spring onions. Top with a small bit of noodles. DO NOT OVER FILL THE ROLL. When there are too many ingredients, they make it really hard to roll nicely and the sides may break open. It's better to make more rolls than distorted looking ultra fat rolls. This is how you roll. Lift the front part of the rice sheet over the ingredients. Tuck the ingredients in with your fingers. Pull one side of the sheet over. And then the other side.

"You make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour.

I use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. You roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (I use setting '3' on my KitchenAid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. Once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long.

"Heat a medium skillet to medium with one tablespoon of olive oil. When hot, drop in the sliced red onion and stir to coat with the oil. 3)When the onions have sweated a little, after 2 or 3 minutes or so, give another stir and sprinkle lightly with kosher salt. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Leave alone and cook for 7-10 minutes (they will caramelize-red onions caramelize easily), checking once to make sure the heat isn't too high that the pan burns. Turn off heat and put onions aside. While your onions are cooking, bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and drop in your broccoli florets. Cook for 2 minutes and then submerge in an ice bath (bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes) or run continuously under cold water for a few minutes. The idea is to stop the broccoli from cooking immediately. 9)Drain when cold and set aside. I browned my chicken on both sides in an oiled skillet, and then added a little chicken stock, covered and simmered till it was cooked through but you can cook your chicken anyway you like. Once your onions, broccoli, and chicken are cooked, and your cheeses grated (please grate your own-there are very few instances when pre-grated is okay! huge HUGE flavor and texture difference for the price.) it's time to make your sauce. This sauce is essentially a flavored roux. A roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour and many sauces and gravies begin with one. Master a roux and you are halfway to making a delicious sauce. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Wash the lemon well. Cut the lemon in half. Use a reamer or a fork to get all the juice out and reserve in a bowl. 16) Cut each half into quarters and use your fingers to peel out the rest of the fruit, leaving you with just peel. You'll need two medium sauce pans. Put the peel and the milk and half & half in one of the sauce pans. Bring just to a slow boil, stirring occasionally, then remove from heat. Remove the peel and set peel aside. In the second sauce pan, melt the butter over a low medium heat. 21)When melted, whisk in the flour and continue whisking until the mixture is a slight caramel color (just a minute or two). Then very slowly, whisk in the half & half and milk mixture. Keep whisking once everything is incorporated. The sauce will thicken pretty quickly. Turn the heat down if it seems to thicken excessively and add extra milk if necessary. Cook like this for 5 minutes or so, or until the flour no longer tastes raw (stick your finger in there and taste!).

Make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. In short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. If you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. If you leave too much space, the pudding will sag.",yes

As the mixture may be difficult to combine with a spoon, there is no objection to going in with your hands and really giving it a larruping. This done, turn your attention to the pudding bag. Soak the cotton square in warm water and wring it relatively dry. Lay it flat on the kitchen table and flour the top side well. This will form a moist coating of flour on the cloth which is essential to removing the pudding from the bag later. Shake off excess flour. Now dump the pudding mixture in the center of the cloth. The mixture will not be too 'loose' and will remain pretty much upright in a blob. Gather the corners and edges of the cloth up around the mixture to form the 'bag' around the pudding and tie off the pudding. Make allowance for some rising (the eggs) and some swelling during cooking. In short, don't tie the bag completely tight about the mixture, but leave a small emptiness between the string and the pudding. If you do it right, the ultimate pudding will have the form of a flattened orb, swelling to the precise size you have left in the bag. If you leave too much space, the pudding will sag. Leave a loop in the string so you can thrust in the handle of a long wooden spoon to retrieve the finished pudding from the boiling water. Everything is going to be wicked hot when the time comes, and the loop is a must. Also, tie the knot around the bag so it can be easily untied.",no

I may try this another time, although it was quite delicious as it was. I also think that when cooking it in the crockpot, it would be OK to put all of the ingredients in at once in the beginning instead of waiting to add the peas, lentils and barley later.",yes

Remove giblets, neck, etc.  Set these aside for stock or gravy.  Rinse the bird thoroughly with cold running water, inside and out. Place the turkey in the bag, neck down and ankles up.  Stuff the cavity with shallots and orange quarters.  Pour the cooled brine into the cavity and allow the bag to fill. Draw up the bag close around the bird, eliminating as much air as possible.  If the turkey is not covered by the brine at this point, add enough water to make it so. Secure the bag closure with a twist tie.  Double-bagging is recommended, in case the brining bag springs a leak. Refrigerate for 12 - 24 hours, turning the bird every 6 to 8 hours. Remove the turkey from the brine about 30-40 minutes before roasting and allow to come up to room temp. Discard everything that remains from the brining process.

Next add the wet ingredients and mix till fairly smooth. Small lumps may still be remaining, this is okay...you don't need to be too neurotic with the mixing. Once you're batter is prepared, prep the bananas into slices and have both bananas and chocolate chips on hand. Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Heat is key for good pancakes. Too hot and you'll burn them, too low and it'll take forever to get a nice golden brown. Adjust often and don't add too many pancakes to the pan. I actually cook my pancakes one at a time and either feed to 'the family' as I make them or  add them to a heated plate in the stove (at warming temp). If you have a nice big grill or electric grittle, go buck wild and know that I'm jealous. Once the pan is heated, add about a 1/2 tablespoon of oil, heat, and then add the batter. Place four or five bananas slices in the batter and sprinkle with chocolate chips... I prefer to not mix the banana and chocolate chips into the batter ahead of time, partly because Jac like it this way, partly because the bananas get a nice fry on them, and partly because you can get perfect chocolate chip distribution throughout the pancake (Can you say neurotic?). If you do follow this precision technique, be sure to push each chocolate chip into the pancake so that the chocolate is sufficiently covered by the batter. Yes, it is a labor of love...did I mention my wife's pregnant? After about 3-4 min. on one side, flip pancake and cook for about the same time till golden brown.",no

"Cream shortening, then add remaining ingredients. This recipe yields 3 cupsof frosting. This produces frosting with a stiff consistency, perfect for piping roses. For a medium consistency, (for borders) add 1 tsp. water to each cup of frosting For a thin consistency, (suitable for icing the cake and writing or leaves) add 2 tsp. water to each cup of stiff frosting. I usually double this recipe when icing a two layer 9 inch cake with frosting decorations. Meringue powder and Valencia flavoring are both sold at my local party store.

When you've used 8 sheets of phyllo, give it another brush with butter, place the brie in the center of the buttered phyllo pile. If you want to add something on top of the brie, now is the time to do it. I sometimes spread the top with pesto and sprinkle the pesto layer with pignoli nuts. Another idea is to make a paste of sun dried tomatoes and cured black olives and spread that on top of the brie. You could also leave it plain, but the topping do add a wonderful flavor. Now to wrap-it's done just like a package. 5Flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown.

When you've used 8 sheets of phyllo, give it another brush with butter, place the brie in the center of the buttered phyllo pile. If you want to add something on top of the brie, now is the time to do it. I sometimes spread the top with pesto and sprinkle the pesto layer with pignoli nuts. Another idea is to make a paste of sun dried tomatoes and cured black olives and spread that on top of the brie. You could also leave it plain, but the topping do add a wonderful flavor. Now to wrap-it's done just like a package. 5Flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. The brie inside will have melted. Cut into wedges & serve. Flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet.
