Pizzocheri Alla Valtellina,023cee435829c1d81e222b0cacd0214c,172575969,0,"You make the pizzocheri as you would any fresh pasta, but using 2 parts of buckwheat flour to one part regular wheat flour. (Buckwheat flour lacks gluten and needs some help to form a workable dough. Some recipes call for less regular flour, but the 2:1 ratio works well for me.) I use egg (and a bit of water) to bind the dough, but the original recipe (see below) calls for water only. You roll out the pasta rather thicker than other kinds of fresh pasta (I use setting '3' on my KitchenAid pasta roller) and let the rolled pasta sheets dry on a towel. Once dry enough, cut the sheets into strips, a bit wider than for fettuccine or tagliatelle, say about 2 cm (1/2 inch) wide and about 5 cm (3 in) long. Allow these little strips to dry out further while you prepare the rest of the dish (see photo above).",yes

Slice or cube the potato, as you prefer (I like them sliced) and immerse them in cold water. Shred your cabbage and add it, too, to the water. Instead of Savoy cabbage, you can also use spinach, swiss chard leaves or—as I did this time when I couldn't find Savoy cabbage at the market—coste, or the stalks of swiss chard, trimmed of their leaves and cut into lengths about the same size as the pizzocheri. Precise proportions are not critical in this kind of dish, but I like to use about one smallish potato and say 100g (4oz.) of leafy vegetable per serving.

But since these cheeses are hard to find, even in Italy, outside their zone of production, fontina is often substituted. And if you can't find fontina, I'd recommend staying in the Alps and using either Gruyère or Emmenthal. Grate about half that amount of parmesan cheese or grana padano.

Brie In Phyllo,034007087acaae069c8d4f2a7f4a1b28,172579843,0,"Don't you just love baked brie? I make mine either in puff pastry (but find it's too heavy these days )& also in a phyllo wrap. Here's how I do it: Remove all the wrapping from a whole brie and cut off about 1/8' off the top, leaving a smooth surface of brie without the rind. Then cut off the edges. Turn brie upside down and remove the rest of the rind. You now have a naked brie. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside. Melt a stick of butter and set aside. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on a flat surface with the long end in front of you.",yes
Brie In Phyllo,034007087acaae069c8d4f2a7f4a1b28,172579843,1," Butter the sheet. Place another sheet of phyllo on top of the first sheet, overlapping half of the first sheet.

Brie In Phyllo,034007087acaae069c8d4f2a7f4a1b28,172579843,3," Now do the same thing with the height, placing the 5th sheet of phyllo.....I guess you get the idea. Don't worry that the middle is thicker. It's going to support the weight of the brie. When you've used 8 sheets of phyllo, give it another brush with butter, place the brie in the center of the buttered phyllo pile. If you want to add something on top of the brie, now is the time to do it. I sometimes spread the top with pesto and sprinkle the pesto layer with pignoli nuts. Another idea is to make a paste of sun dried tomatoes and cured black olives and spread that on top of the brie. You could also leave it plain, but the topping do add a wonderful flavor. Now to wrap-it's done just like a package. 5Flip the wrapped brie over, brush with butter and place on a cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 oven until the phyllo is puffed and golden brown. The brie inside will have melted. Cut into wedges & serve.",yes
